# certo

Turn conversations into verifiable specifications.

## Install

```bash
pip install certo
# or
uv add certo
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Check your project against its spec
certo check

# Start an interview to capture intent
certo interview
```

## Why?

AI-generated code is overwhelming human verification capacity. The gap between what humans intend and what code does has always existed, but it's now at a breaking point.

Certo bridges this gap by capturing intent through conversation, expanding it into testable implications, and checking code against those implications using multiple verification strategies.
